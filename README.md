# Simple-Pos-Software
A simple POS Software created using Java Swing and JDBC.

Summary:

<ol>
  <li>IDE: NetBeans IDE</li>
<li>Front-End: Java Swing</li>
<li>Back-End: JDBC</li>
</ol>


It is a very simple POS Software made using Java.
You need to have a Database with all the product information stored in.
As you add to the cart, it will update the total bill arriving.
It also has the functionality to print the bill.

To run it, make sure you have a databse and a table running. You can use your localhost to run it too.
In my case, I used XAMPP server to access from PhpMyAdmin.

Thanks.

Feel free to copy it and paste as your own coded :).
